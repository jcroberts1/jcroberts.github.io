            <h2>Job Roberts</h2>
            <p>My name is Job Roberts. I am 35 years old I have been in the
                Louisiana Army National Guard going on 15 years,and have been deployed twice over seas.
                I have been a photographer since early 2005 where I picked it up as a hobby but
                over the years has turned into a profession. In 2010 I wanted to start to display
                my photography on a website and at the time it was not in my budget to hire a developer
                to design my site. So I began to teach my self from online classes and tutorials (Google, Youtube).
                Over the years I have gained the experience and knowledge to design my own website and maintain
                it on my own. </p>
             <p>My expertise came with my website launch through GoDaddy where I became familiar
                with WordPress CMS(Content Management System). Since I have maintained my own personal website
                for the past couple of years. In August of 2014 I started my journey at Full Sail University in
                pursuit of my Bachelors degree in Web Design & Development where I am currently attending online
                classes with my graduation in the fall of 2016.
                In summary I am a dedicated professional that is quick and eager to learn. I am motivated
                to get the job done and willing to grow with a company to develop my skills.</p>
