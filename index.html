            <h2>Job Roberts</h2>
            <p>My name is Job Roberts. I am 35 years old I have been in the
                Louisiana Army National Guard going on 15 years,and have been deployed twice over seas.
                I have been a photographer since early 2005 where I picked it up as a hobby but
                over the years has turned into a profession. In 2010 I wanted to start to display
                my photography on a website and at the time it was not in my budget to hire a developer
                to design my site. So I began to teach my self from online classes and tutorials (Google, Youtube).
                Over the years I have gained the experience and knowledge to design my own website and maintain
                it on my own. </p>
             <p>My expertise came with my website launch through GoDaddy where I became familiar
                with WordPress CMS(Content Management System). Since I have maintained my own personal website
                for the past couple of years. In August of 2014 I started my journey at Full Sail University in
                pursuit of my Bachelors degree in Web Design & Development where I am currently attending online
                classes with my graduation in the fall of 2016.
                In summary I am a dedicated professional that is quick and eager to learn. I am motivated
                to get the job done and willing to grow with a company to develop my skills.</p>

                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>Designed for any one looking for a the perfect rental
                    apartment targeting mostly towards females 18-25 years old.Women control a high percentage of purchases and decision making in the consumer world.
                    </p>
                <h3>Client Goals and User Needs</h3>
                <p>The goal for this site is to help people find the right apartment.It fixates a on searching apartments for rent
                    and in-turn will generate revenue for that rental property.
                    </p>
                <h3>Design Critique</h3>
                <p>The first thing you'll notice about this would be the House-icon.
                    "Perfect Rent" is the first thing you'll read because it's
                    bigger and surrounds the house icon which makes it pop out and give emphasis.The designer executed a flawless
                    stand out design by focusing the contrast and opacity of the font. Notice how "Perfect" has more contrast and "Rent" has a slight opacity reduction to it
                    this alone is a simple but effective way of giving this header a stand out look.
                    The designer obviously wanted this to be the focal point and I would say he/she succeeded.

                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p> A business or person in need of a website span across the world in all age and class brackets these days.
                    The professional look of this component gives off a compelling look and feel. This appeal helps to focus towards a young and
                    modernized well established person or business.
                    Most startup companies will not have a general understand nor the budget needed to build websites, so the
                    focus will be on established companies that will become long-term clients.</p>
                <h3>Client Goals and User Needs</h3>

                <h3>Design Critique</h3>
                <p>This component has a very simplistic look and feel about it.
                    The background is a bright white that gives the emotional feeling of goodness, innocence, purity.
                    The grouping of the featured images give a calming feeling.
                    The color of the blue back to top of page button complements
                    the white background instills trust and comfort.
                    The design also has a carousel effect that will allow the user to click on to see more
                    news and stories past the two that are displayed.</p>

The user on the other hand is getting more bang for their buck.I would certainly expect a growing business relationship based on the this.  </p>
                <h3>Design Critique</h3>
                <p>The bright white,often associated with purity, cleanliness, and virtue is adding contrast to the gold buttons and the black typography and icons
                    </p>

                   The images have several matching colors of the background color, but also have some reds and whites to give it a little more intriguing look and feel.The user can focus on the images and content from the utilization of rule-of-thirds.Ui elements the up arrow give the user a quick way to return to the navigation at the top.The use of 'Roboto', sans-serif font also communicates to a modern generation.</p>

                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>This subscribe CTA is from a design website in which is targeted towards mostly males approximately between the ages 20-35 and females 20-35.Adding a subscribe CTA is a great way to keep the target audience informed and to keep coming back. </p>
                <h3>Client Goals and User Needs</h3>
                <p>The goal for the client is to get the user to subscribe via email versus the user clicks because he/she would like to be informed of updates and latest offers and news.</p>
                <h3>Design Critique</h3>
                <p>The use of the classic bright white again makes the border of the field stand out. The red line about the title is what catches the eye and draws the users attention downward .
                    The field also has a tooltip that initiates if you do not fill in a valid email. The use of a bright orange color speaks to the user to be pressed and move on.
